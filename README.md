## 📂 Folder Structure

Here's a breakdown of the repository's structure:

| Path                  | Description                                                                 |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `.`                   | Main configuration files like `.bash_profile`, `.zshrc`, `.vimrc`, etc.     |
| ├── 📂 `bash/`        | `bash`-specific configurations, including prompt, colors, and auto-completion. |
| ├── 📂 `zsh/`         | `zsh`-specific configurations, leveraging Oh My Zsh for plugins and themes. |
| ├── 📂 `common/`      | Shared configurations between `bash` and `zsh` (aliases, functions, exports).|
| ├── 📂 `config/`      | Configuration files for other applications (e.g., Terminator).              |
| ├── 📂 `vim/`         | Vim-related files, such as color schemes.                                   |
| ├── 📂 `setup/`       | Scripts for setting up the dotfiles on different operating systems.         |
| ├── 📂 `ssh/`         | SSH client configuration.                                                   |
| ├── 📂 `untracked/`   | For private configurations, not tracked by Git (e.g., machine-specific settings). |

## 🔒 Untracked Configuration

The `untracked/` directory is intentionally left out of version control, making it the perfect place to store sensitive or machine-specific information, such as:

*   **SSH configurations** with private host details.
*   **Shell settings** with environment variables or secrets.

For example, you can create a `bashconfig` or `sshconfig` file inside the `untracked/` directory to define private aliases, functions, or SSH hosts. These files will be automatically sourced, so you can easily extend the dotfiles without committing personal data to the repository.

## pre-commit Hooks

This repository uses `pre-commit` to enforce code quality and consistency. The pre-commit hooks are configured in the `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file and are run automatically before each commit.

To use the pre-commit hooks, you need to install `pre-commit` on your local
machine. The setup script will do this for you, but if you need to do it
manually, you can use Homebrew on macOS:

```bash
brew install pre-commit
```

Once `pre-commit` is installed, you need to install the git hooks:

```bash
pre-commit install
```

Now, the pre-commit hooks will run automatically every time you make a commit.
